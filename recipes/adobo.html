        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A recipe for Filipino <b>Chicken and Pork Adobo</b> – a classic dish that braises chicken and pork to tender perfection in a flavorful soy and vinegar sauce.</p>
        <p>This cooking method, like most of Filipino culture, is of mixed heritage. While not official, many consider chicken adobo to be the national dish of the Philippines. There are many regional varieties of adobo, but most recipes include vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and black pepper. The meat is marinated and then stewed in this mixture, which yields a very flavorful, tangy, and tender meat. Adobo is usually served over a bed of fluffy rice to absorb the deliciously tangy sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 chicken legs on the bone</li>
            <li>1 small pork tenderloin sliced in 1/2 inch rounds</li>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce I like Silver Swan for this recipe</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 small head of garlic minced</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the chicken and pork in soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and pepper, in a non-reactive bowl, for 30 minutes to 1 hour, rotating at least once. The chicken can also marinate overnight.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken, bay leaves and marinade in a deep sided sauté pan and cook over medium heat. When the sauce is bubbling, turn the chicken and cook until the meat is nearly cooked through, about 15 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a bowl, add oil to the pan, and brown the chicken and pork on all sides, working in batches. Return the sauce to the pan, bring to a boil and lower heat to a simmer. Adjust the sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Cook for about 20-30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce a thick and deep color.</li>
            <li>Serve over steaming rice</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>This recipe is easily adaptable - use all chicken or all pork if you wish - and make more sauce (because to me, the sauce is the best part) by simply adding equal parts of soy sauce to vinegar. It's best served over rice, with lots of sauce!</p>
