        <p>Dinakdakan or warek-warek is an Ilocano delicacy made with grilled pork parts such as the face, ears, liver, and tongue. It’s traditionally served as a bar chow or pulutan to go with ice-cold beer but has evolved over the years into a hearty main dish enjoyed with piping-hot steamed rice.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds pork face snout, ears</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pepper corns</li>
            <li>1/2 pound pork liver</li>
            <li>8 ounces pig brain</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cup calamansi juice</li>
            <li>1 red onion peeled and sliced thinly</li>
            <li>1 thumb-size ginger peeled and minced</li>
            <li>3 Thai chili peppers stemmed and minced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork face, salt, peppercorns, bay leaves, and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.</li>
            <li>Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until meat is tender but not falling apart. With a slotted spoon, remove meat and drain well.</li>
            <li>Add liver to the pot and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes or until half-done. Remove from pan and drain well.</li>
            <li>Add pig brain to pot and cook for about 8 to 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove brain and transfer into a bowl. With a fork, mash until smooth. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Over hot coals, grill pork for about 4 to 6 minutes on each side or until crisp and slightly charred. Allow to cool to touch and slice thinly</li>
            <li>Grill liver for about 3 to 5 minutes until nicely charred and fully cooked.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine pork meat, onions, ginger, and chili peppers.</li>
            <li>Add calamansi juice and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Add mashed pig brain and stir until well-distributed. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>If pig brain is unavailable or to make the dish more “kid-friendly”, swap the mashed brain with mayonnaise to add the characteristic creaminess.</p>
